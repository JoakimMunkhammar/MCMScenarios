# MCMScenarios
Markov-chain mixture (MCM) distribution scenario forecasting model

This function uses training data and an observation point for making any number of scenarios for any number of time-steps ahead. Instructions are given in the MCMScenarios.m file, and a test file Example.m along with an example data set for training Train.txt is included and should be placed in the same folder for use.

It is a scenario version of the Markov-chain Mixture Distribution (MCM) model.
